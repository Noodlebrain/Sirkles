SIRKLES is a rhythm game controlled by
mouse and keyboard. There are pieces of background music, and users are
tasked with tapping the circles appearing on the screen, which
roughly follow the rhythm of the background music. The game
provides four levels based on difficulties. Each level has different
background music and different numbers of circles. More circles
make it more difficult to tap all of them. Score is counted;
hitting a circle on time yields 150 points.

To start the game, users should open the racket file
“Sirkles.rkt” and click RUN on the top right corner. After running
the game, users first press Z or X to read the instructions and
then press Z or X to start. To gain points, users must move the
mouse over each circle and press Z or X or click the circle at the
appropriate time.
